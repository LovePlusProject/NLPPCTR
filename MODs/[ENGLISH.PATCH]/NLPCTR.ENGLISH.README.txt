[NLPPCTR] ENGLISH TRANSLATION PATCH
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Download the latest build of CITRA here:
https://citra-emulator.com/download

Run Citra, 'double-click to add a new folder to the game list'
and direct it to where you have stored your 3DS/CIA file of the NLP+ game.

Right-click the game in the list, and click 'Open Mods Location',
it should open a folder named '00040000000F4E00', enter this folder and create
a new folder called 'romfs', this folder is meant for changing text in the scripts and/or
code files, and where you'll be placing all your edited textures to succesfully load in the game.

You'll locate the '00040000000F4E00' 'romfs' directory in:
C:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\mods\00040000000F4E00\romfs\

To inject the CITRA version of the [English Translation Project_tR28%],
make a copy of the 'Script' and 'SystemData' folders in 'romfs',
with the translated folder files from the [NLPPCTR]'s link: 
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BENGLISH.PATCH%5D
(NOT FULLY TRANSLATED YET)

Also move the project's translated graphics to your 'load' textures folder:
C:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\textures\

Any files in the {IM.BIN} folder are Not applicable in CITRA without some further modifications,
these files will need to be repacked/Injected into the 'img.bin' file in order to work in the game.

Right click on the game in the CITRA starting screen, and click 'Dump RomFS',
the freshly dumped game files generated will be located at:
C:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra\dump\romfs\00040000000F4E00\

Make a copy of the 'img.bin' file in the 'load' folder before you edit that file, then
proceed to use the 'nlpp-tools', and follow their instructions to perform the 'repack' action:
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/nlpp-tools

After you're done with the repacking process, dont forget to make sure the repacked file is in:
C:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\mods\00040000000F4E00\romfs\img.bin

JSON File:
Custom textures use a JSON configuration file (pack.json) for metadata,
including pack name, author, hash format, and options for mipmap generation or texture flipping.
Download and place a copy of this file in both the game's 'dump' and 'load' folders, in order
for all of our Project's MODs to work properly, if your system has create such a file, replace it:

Before running the game for the first time, right-click the game
in the game list again, and click 'Properties>Enhancements>'
and tick the 'Rotate Screens Upright' box in order for
the game to always display with the correct orientation.
Also tick the following:
[Use Custom Textures]: Game will load any edited texture file you
paste into the 'load' textures folder, like the translated menu images.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The English patch will be automatically applied every time you run the game,
however note that currently most of the instructions and button graphics
have not yet been fully edited and translated, you'd have to navigate the
Japanese menus in order to create your profile, and start the game, phone apps
such as 'googletranslate' that have a live camera translate feature should come
in handy till you set everything up, and before you become accustomed to the game's menu.
