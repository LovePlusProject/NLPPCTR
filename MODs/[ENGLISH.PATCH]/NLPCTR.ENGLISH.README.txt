[NLPPCTR] ENGLISH TRANSLATION PATCH
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Download the latest build of CITRA here:
https://citra-emulator.com/download

Run Citra, 'double-click to add a new folder to the game list'
and direct it to where you have stored your 3DS/CIA file of the NLP+ game.

Right-click the game in the list, and click 'Open Mods Location',
it should open a folder named '00040000000F4E00',
enter this folder and create a new folder called 'romfs', this folder
is meant for changing text in the scripts and/or code files in the game.

You'll locate the '00040000000F4E00' directory in:
_:\Users\___\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\mods

If you wish to inject the CITRA version of the [English Translation Project_tR28%],
Move/Replace the 'Script' and 'SystemData' folders in 'romfs'
with the translated folder files from the [NLPPCTR]'s link: 
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BENGLISH.PATCH%5D
(NOT FULLY TRANSLATED YET)
Also move the project's translated graphics to your 'load' texture folder:
_:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\textures

JSON File:
Custom textures use a JSON configuration file (pack.json) for metadata,
including pack name, author, hash format, and options for mipmap generation
or texture flipping. Download and place a copy of this file in both 'dump' and 'load' folders,
in order for all of our Project's MODs to work properly, if your system has create such a file, replace it:

Before running the game for the first time, right-click the game
in the game list again, and click 'Properties>Enhancements>'
and tick the 'Rotate Screens Upright' box in order for
the game to always display with the correct orientation.
Also tick the following:
[Use Custom Textures]: Game will load any edited texture
file you paste into the 'load' folder.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The English patch will be automatically applied every time you run the game,
however note that currently most of the instructions and not all
the button graphics have not yet been fully edited and translated,
you'd have to navigate the Japanese menus in order to create your profile,
and start the game, phone apps such as 'googletranslate' that have a
live camera translate feature should come in handy till you set everything up,
and before you become accustomed to the game's menu.
