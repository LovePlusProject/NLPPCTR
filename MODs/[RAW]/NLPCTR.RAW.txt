[NLPPCTR] RAW MATERIAL
2025-10-30_DISCLAIMER: WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON FINDING A WAY TO DUMP ALL CITRA TEXTURES AT ONCE,
SO THAT WE CAN OFFER THE RAW MATTERIAL FOR THE CUSTOMIZING MODs PROJECT TO FINALLY BEGIN, IN THE MEANTIME
PLAYING THE GAME WILL DUMP ALL THE TEXTURES YOU COME ACROSS, AND EDITING/LOADING THEM IS A FULLY FUNCTIONAL PROCESS.
VISIT HERE AGAIN SOON FOR ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
After running the game for the first time click
'Emulation>Configure Current Game...>Enhancements>'
and tick the 'Rotate Screens Upright' box in order for
the game to always display with the correct orientation.

Also tick the following:
[Use Custom Textures]: Game will load any edited texture
file you paste into the 'load' folder.
[Dump Textures]: Game will dump any texture you encounter
while playing the game in a 'dump' folder.

Read more info on the preferences concerning the textures here:
https://citra-emulator.com/custom-textures/

To locate your 'dump/load' texture folders, navigate to:
_:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra

Visit here to pre-download ALL the RAW textures of the game:
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BRAW%5D

Keep the RAW/Original files in the 'dump' folder,
Make a copy of any texture file you wish to change,
and move it in the 'load' folder before you work on them.

To view the changes in real time, reboot the game after each change.
