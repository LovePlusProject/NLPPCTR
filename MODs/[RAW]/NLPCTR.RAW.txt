Also tick the following:
[Use Custom Textures]: Game will load any edited texture
file you paste into the 'load' folder.
[Dump Textures]: Game will dump any texture you encounter
while playing the game in a 'dump' folder.

Read more info on the preferences concerning the textures here:

Keep the RAW/Original files in the 'dump' folder,
Make a copy of any texture file you wish to change,
and move it in the 'load' folder before you work on them.

To view the changes in real time, reboot the game after each change.
