JSON File:
Custom textures use a JSON configuration file (pack.json) for metadata,
including pack name, author, hash format, and options for mipmap generation
or texture flipping. Download and place a copy of this file in both 'dump' and 'load' folders,
in order for all of our Project's MODs to work properly, if your system has create such a file, replace it:
