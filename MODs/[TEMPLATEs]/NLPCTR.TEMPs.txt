[NLPPCTR] TEMPLATEs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We have created a few TEMPs/TEMPLATEs
to make MODs/MODDING more accessible,
visit here often for new TEMPs PACK releases:
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BTEMPLATEs%5D

Right click the game in the CITRA menu and
choose Emulation>Configure Current Game...>Enhancements>
then tick the following features:
[Use Custom Textures]: Game will load any edited texture
file you paste into the 'load' folder.
[Dump Textures]: Game will dump any texture you encounter
while playing the game in a 'dump' folder.

Read more info on the preferences concerning the textures here:
https://citra-emulator.com/custom-textures/

To locate your 'dump/load' texture folders, navigate to:
_:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra

Keep the RAW/Original files in the 'dump' folder,
Make a copy of any texture file you wish to change,
and move it in the 'load' folder before you work on them.

All edited textures must be placed in the 'load' folder
and maintain their original name in order to work properly. 

To view the changes in real time, reboot the game after each change.
