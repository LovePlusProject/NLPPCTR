[NLPPCTR] TEMPLATEs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We have created a few TEMPs/TEMPLATEs
to make MODs/MODDING more accessible,
visit here often for new TEMPs PACK releases:
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BTEMPLATEs%5D

Before running the game for the first time, right-click the game
in the game list, and click 'Properties>Enhancements>'
and tick the 'Rotate Screens Upright' box in order for
the game to always display with the correct orientation.

Also tick the following:
[Use Custom Textures]: Game will load any edited texture
file you paste into the 'load' folder.
[Dump Textures]: Game will dump any texture you encounter
while playing the game in a 'dump' folder.

Read more info on the preferences concerning the textures here:
https://citra-emulator.com/custom-textures/
https://citra-emulator.pro/citra-texture-dumping-and-custom-textures-guide/

To locate your 'dump/load' texture folders, navigate to:
_:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra

Export any edited Texture MODs files you wish to use in the 'load' textures folder:
C:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\textures\00040000000F4E00

JSON File:
Custom textures use a JSON configuration file (pack.json) for metadata,
including pack name, author, hash format, and options for mipmap generation or texture flipping.
Download and place a copy of this file in both the game's 'dump' and 'load' texture folders, in order for
all of our Project's MODs to work properly, if your system has create such a file, replace it:
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/blob/949310f8eee2b09ab56d30b7d157cd733f417403/MODs/%5BNLPPCTR%5D_JSONFILE.zip

If needed, visit here to pre-download ALL the RAW textures of the game:
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BRAW%5D

To edit textures, keep the RAW/Original files in the 'dump' textures folder,
Move a copy of any texture file you wish to edit in the 'load' textures folder
before you work on them.

All edited textures must be placed in the 'load' textures folder, a copy of
our pack.json must be copied in both dump/load textures folders, and files must
maintain their original name in order for this process to work properly.

To view the changes in real time, reboot the game after each change.
