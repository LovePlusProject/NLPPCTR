Download the latest build of CITRA here:
https://citra-emulator.com/download

Run Citra, 'double-click to add a new folder to the game list'
and direct it to where you have stored your 3DS/CIA file of the NLP+ game.

Right-click the game in the list, and click 'Open Mods Location',
it should open a folder named '00040000000F4E00',
enter this folder and create a new folder called 'romfs', this folder
is meant for changing text in the scripts and/or code files in the game.

If you wish to inject the CITRA version of the [English Translation Project],
Move/Replace the 'Script' and 'SystemData' folders in 'romfs'
with the translated folder files from the project's link: 
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BENGLISH.PATCH%5D
(NOT FULLY TRANSLATED YET, CURRENTLY IN PROCESS)

After running the game for the first time click
'Emulation>Configure Current Game...>Enhancements>'
and tick the 'Rotate Screens Upright' box in order for
the game to always display with the correct orientation.

Also tick the following:
[Use Custom Textures]: Game will load any edited texture
file you paste into the 'load' folder.
[Dump Textures]: Game will dump any texture you encounter
while playing the game in a 'dump' folder.

Read more info on the preferences concerning the textures here:
https://citra-emulator.com/custom-textures/

To locate your 'dump/load' texture folders, navigate to:
_:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra

Visit here to pre-download ALL the RAW textures of the game:
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BRAW%5D

Keep the RAW/Original files in the 'dump' folder,
Make a copy of any texture file you wish to change,
and move it in the 'load' folder before you work on them.

To view the changes in real time, reboot the game after each change.
