Download the latest build of CITRA here:
https://citra-emulator.com/download

Run Citra, 'double-click to add a new folder to the game list'
and direct it to where you have stored your 3DS file of the NLP+ game.

Right-click the game in the list, and click 'Open Mods Location',
it should open a folder named '00040000000F4E00',
enter this folder and create a new folder called 'romfs', this folder
is meant for changing text in the scripts and/or code files in the game.

If you wish to inject the CITRA version of the [English Translation Project],
Move/Replace the 'Script' and 'SystemData' folders in 'romfs'
with the translated folder files from the project's link: 
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BENGLISH.PATCH%5D
(NOT FULLY TRANSLATED YET)
Also move the project's translated graphics to your 'load' texture folder:
_:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\textures

Before running the game for the first time, right-click the game
in the game list again, and click 'Properties>Enhancements>'
and tick the 'Rotate Screens Upright' box in order for
the game to always display with the correct orientation.

Also tick the following:
[Use Custom Textures]: Game will load any edited texture
file you paste into the 'load' folder.
Alternatively you can also tick if needed:
[Dump Textures]: Game will dump any texture you encounter
while playing the game in a 'dump' folder.

Read more info on the preferences concerning the textures here:
https://citra-emulator.com/custom-textures/

To locate your 'dump/load' texture folders, navigate to:
_:\Users\____\AppData\Roaming\Citra

JSON File:
Custom textures use a JSON configuration file (pack.json) for metadata,
including pack name, author, hash format, and options for mipmap generation
or texture flipping. Download and place a copy of this file in both 'dump' and 'load' folders,
in order for all of our Project's MODs to work properly, if your system has create such a file, replace it:

If needed, visit here to pre-download ALL the RAW textures of the game:
https://github.com/LovePlusProject/NLPPCTR/tree/main/MODs/%5BRAW%5D

To edit textures, keep the RAW/Original files in the 'dump' folder,
Move a copy of any texture file you wish to edit in the 'load' folder
before you work on them.

All edited textures must be placed in the 'load' folder, a copy of
our pack.json must be copied in both dump/load folders, and files must
maintain their original name in order for this process to work properly.

To view the changes in real time, reboot the game after each change.
